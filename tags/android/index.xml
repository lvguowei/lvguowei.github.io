      <description>In Part I we talked about how to setup Espresso testing framework, what is the activity testing rule and how to use uiautomatorviewer to help us find id of the view quickly.
In this Part II, we will write some tests against a simple TODO list application. Lets get started.
About the App under test This is a very simple app with basically 2 screens. One to display a list of tasks:</description>

      <description>The Espresso testing framework really makes it easy to write UI tests for Android. In this first installment, I will go through how to set it up and write our first test case.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Set up Espresso Add the following dependencies to your gradle build file.
dependencies { // Other dependencies ... androidTestCompile &amp;#39;com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.2&amp;#39; }  Understand the Rules in JUnit Why do they exist? We all know that in JUnit there is a setup method(annotated as @Before) and a teardown method(annotated as @After).</description>

      <title>Android Emulator Problem In Arch Linux</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t remember since when, but now whenever I upgrade Android Studio from pacman, I cannot open my emulator, with some libGL error: unable to load driver: i965_dri.so error.
I tried to follow the solution online but found none of them is working out of the box, because Android Sdk changed some paths. Here is what actualy works now:
 cd ANDROID_SDK_PATH/emulator/lib64/libstdc++/ mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.bak ln -s /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6  </description>

      <title>Rxjava fromCallable() Vs defer()</title>

      <description>In this post we talk about how to use Observable.fromCallable() and Observable.defer() to convert exising functionality into the Rx.
Imagine that you have a UserService class, in it there is a getUserFromDb() function. This function is developed before RxJava and cannot be changed. But somehow you need a function which returns a Observable&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;. What could you do?
The UserService Example public class UserService { /** * Gets User from database, this should not be run in UI thread.</description>

      <description>In this post, we will discuss how to implement a custom view group by extending an existing one, like a FrameLayout.
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that we are building a layout for displaying user&amp;rsquo;s avatar. The requirement is if a user has an avatar, show the avatar picture, if not, show their initials as text.
So it would be good if we have some kind of AvatarView and Avatar data class (which contains name and avatar picture).</description>

      <description>In this installment, we talk about how to implement custom view group.
There are two ways of doing custom view groups: 1. Extends an existing ViewGroup, like LinearLayout or FrameLayout. 2. Extends the base ViewGroup class.
Normally, the first way will do the trick. But in this post, we are talking about the second one.
Basically you have to implement both onMeasure() and onLayout().
The details are kind of straightforward, take a look at the commented source code</description>

      <description>In this post, we finally gonna take a look at how to implement onMeasure() properly.
When implementing a custom view, we should always consider its lower and upper size limit. In this case since the format of the time is fixed (hh:mm:ss). So we just need to get the width and height of it.
Suppose we set the MAX_TIME = &amp;quot;00:00:00&amp;quot;, then to get its width in pixel we can do:</description>

      <description>In Part I, we talked about how to create a simple custom view. But we don&amp;rsquo;t really implement the onMeasure(). In this post, we will analyze what problems we will have if we omit the onMeasure().
You can think of how the measurements are made as a conversation between the child and parent views.
The child tells its parent how it wants to be laid out by using LayoutParams. This can either be set in xml file or programatically.</description>

      <description>Creating your own custom android views can be useful and daunting at the same time. For a long time there is nobody really talks about it in a approachable way, until this lady Huyen Tue Dao. Let&amp;rsquo;s try to follow her approach and create some custom view!
In this part, we will create a very simple timer view that takes up the whole screen and display the current time.
 So let&amp;rsquo;s get started.</description>

      <title>Why we stopped using dagger and some thoughts</title>

      <description>I decided to stop using Dagger2 in our company&amp;rsquo;s android project. Why?
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Dagger2 is still great. But though it is great, it is complex. Lots of concepts to wrap our heads around. What is a component, what is a module, what is the difference between subcomponent and dependency component, etc. In order to use it properly, we need to anwser all that questions, even you think you understand it, you still run into suprises now and then.</description>

      <description>Since I have been doing programming kata, why not adopt the same kata concept in Android programming?
Over the years I have accumulated some useful tools / tricks that I can show in kata form.
The goal is to keep it simple and easy to grasp and to the point.
This is the first one, which shows how to use ViewPropertyAnimator to animate show and hide of the FAB button.</description>

      <title>Use Interface Segregation Principle to Implement an Android Logger</title>
      <link>http://lvguowei.me/post/interface-segregation-principle-android-logger/</link>

      <description>Recently at work we has been talking about implementing some kind of Analytic interface for all the analytic libraries we are using, like Localytics and Firebase and so on. Basically it is just a fat interface with a long list of event logging functions, like logSignIn(), logSignOut(), logSellProduct(), logOpenMap() and so on. There are about 40 such methods in that interface. So this is how we implemented it in the first place.</description>

      <title>Duplicate Observed Data</title>

      <description>This is from the famous Refactoring book by Martin Fowler. When I was reading it, it feels very similar to the very popular MVP or MVVM.
The key idea is that in system that has user interface, the business logic should be separated from the user interface.
One example I can think of is the registration form, where there are input fields like username, email, phone number and password. We can have some logic that disable the Register button until all fields are filled and the phone number and email valid.</description>
