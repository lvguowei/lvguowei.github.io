      <description>I decided to stop using Dagger2 in our company&amp;rsquo;s android project. Why?
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Dagger2 is still great. But though it is great, it is complex. Lots of concepts to wrap our heads around. What is a component, what is a module, what is the difference between subcomponent and dependency component, etc. In order to use it properly, we need to anwser all that questions, even you think you understand it, you still run into suprises now and then.</description>

      <description>Since I have been doing programming kata, why not adopt the same kata concept in Android programming?
Over the years I have accumulated some useful tools / tricks that I can show in kata form.
The goal is to keep it simple and easy to grasp and to the point.
This is the first one, which shows how to use ViewPropertyAnimator to animate show and hide of the FAB button.</description>

      <title>Use Interface Segregation Principle to Implement an Android Logger</title>

      <description>Recently at work we has been talking about implementing some kind of Analytic interface for all the analytic libraries we are using, like Localytics and Firebase and so on. Basically it is just a fat interface with a long list of event logging functions, like logSignIn(), logSignOut(), logSellProduct(), logOpenMap() and so on. There are about 40 such methods in that interface. So this is how we implemented it in the first place.</description>

      <title>Duplicate Observed Data</title>

      <description>This is from the famous Refactoring book by Martin Fowler. When I was reading it, it feels very similar to the very popular MVP or MVVM.
The key idea is that in system that has user interface, the business logic should be separated from the user interface.
One example I can think of is the registration form, where there are input fields like username, email, phone number and password. We can have some logic that disable the Register button until all fields are filled and the phone number and email valid.</description>
