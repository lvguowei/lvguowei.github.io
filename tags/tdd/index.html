    If you have ever tried writing any non trivial tests, mocks should not be a stranger to you. But what about some other &ldquo;mock&rdquo; like objects like stubs, spies and such? How are they different from each other? In this blog post, I will explain it as simple and easy to remember as possible.
Everything is a test double. Test double is just a general name for all mock like objects.  <a href="http://lvguowei.me/post/mock-objects-dimistified/">Read More...</a>

    I stumbled upon this video, and boy it is so amazing! (if you ignore the annoying audience asking non-stop some annoying questions). This is clearly one of the most inspiring videos I have ever watched. So I must take some notes down and spread the idea as well.
I deeply believe that it is actually easy to make things complicated, on the contrary, it is hard to make things simple and elegant.  <a href="http://lvguowei.me/post/stub-and-mock-harmful/">Read More...</a>

    In one of Uncle Bob&rsquo;s video, he talked about this game called &ldquo;Master Mind&rdquo; when he was teaching Single Responsibility Principle(SRP). After googled the game, turns out that it is actually a quite famous board game. For more information about the game, please look here -&gt; wiki.
The game can be played by two people. One comes up with a code, the other one tries to guess. The one who comes up with the code has to score the guesser&rsquo;s guess based on some rules.  <a href="http://lvguowei.me/post/master-mind-tdd/">Read More...</a>
